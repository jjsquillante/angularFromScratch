// A watcher is something that is notified when a change occurs on the scope. 
// You can create a watcher by calling $watch with two arguments, both of which should be functions:
// • A watch function, which specifies the piece of data you’re interested in.
// • A listener function which will be called whenever that data changes.

// The other side of the coin is the $digest function. It iterates over all the watchers that have been
// attached on the scope, and runs their watch and listener functions accordingly.
